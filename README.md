An amateurish Python script to sync AWS S3 buckets from one account to another.

The use-case that spawned this was the need to sync S3 buckets into an AWS account for the China region. Since the China region of AWS is only available as a fully seperate account from the other regions, the S3 syncing provided by Amazon does not work.
